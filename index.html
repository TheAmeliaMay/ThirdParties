    <h2>What are third parties?</h2>
    <p>Third parties are minor political parties in the United States, other than the Democrats and Republicans. These parties are less corrupt, but also less successful, being at a severe disadvantage due to the first-past-the-post system, tough ballot access laws, and plenty of other restrictions.</p>
